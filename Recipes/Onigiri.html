        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Salt</li>

        </ul>

        <h4><i>Optional</i></h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Nori</li>
        <li>Furikake<i> (Also known as rice seasoning)</i></li>
        <li>Fillings <i>(This can be whatever you choose to have in the center such as tuna, salmon, veggies, etc.)</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol> 
        <li>Once the rice is cooked and cooled down, all you have to do is shape them.  I have a difficult time with this, so what I’ve learned to do is use some plastic wrap.  Put a scoop of rice in the middle of the plastic wrap and wrap it up.   </li>
        <li>Now, the shaping.  Hold the wrapped up rice in your hand.  Cup your hand so it looks like a “U”, and then cup your other hand, perpendicularly, on top of it tightly.  Gently squeeze the rice.  If you’re doing it correctly, it should start to look kind of like a triangle.  Then, rotate the rice ball in your hands, so a different point is pointing downward and repeat. </li>
        <li>Take the rice out of the plastic wrap and form it a few times with your bare hands.  Then place it on a plate, and sprinkle some salt on them.</li>
        <li>You can add nori to just about any type of onigiri.  You’ll need to cut up the nori to fit, but you can cut it into any shape you want, be it a larger sheet to cover the entire onigiri, a small little rectangle for just on the bottom, or some cute shapes.</li>
    </ol>
